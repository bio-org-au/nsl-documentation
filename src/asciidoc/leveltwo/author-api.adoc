=== Author API V1.0

==== deduplicate

**DELETE deduplicate** Deduplicate author. Takes a duplicate author and replaces it with a target author. All References
and Names that currently use the duplicate author will have the author replaced with the target author. The mapper is
updated so that URL IDs are updated to refer to the target author. The duplicate author is then deleted from the database.

.Parameters

* user - (optional) The user to blame, defaults to the administrator.

WARNING: This will delete the duplicate author. You need to be an administrator to do this, so you will need an apiKey
if calling it from a service.

.example

curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" -X DELETE https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/author/apni/3456/api/deduplicate?target=12345&apiKey=blah_blah_blah&user=fred

.response
