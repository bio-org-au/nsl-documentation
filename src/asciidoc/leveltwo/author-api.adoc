**DELETE deduplicate** Deduplicate author. Takes a duplicate author and replaces it with a target author. All References
and Names that currently use the duplicate author will have the author replaced with the target author. The mapper is
updated so that URL IDs are updated to refer to the target author. The duplicate author is then deleted from the database.

if calling it from a service.
