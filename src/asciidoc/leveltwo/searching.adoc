=== Searching the NSL

The current NSL service includes the APNI and APC data. APNI is a nomenclator, it includes a list of names of vascular
plants and where they have been used in references. In this sense, APNI has no opinion about the name, it just states
where and how it has been used in a reference.

APC is a consensus-based classification, it provides an opinion about what is the accepted name, and where the taxon sits in the classification
"tree".

.What is a tree?
****
We may speak of "trees" when referring to classifications in the NSL system, which shouldn't be confused with
actual woody vascular plants. A tree in this sense is the structure of set of names:  where one name is in relation to other names. For example, the plant family name is "above" the names of its constituent genera, a genus name ranks "below"  the family in the tree. A family may contain many genera and each genus many species and so on.

When you look at the NSL services page you will see the APNI and APC "products" as links in the "Navigation Bar" at the
top of the page. To search APNI click the APNI link.

The search page consists of a set of search forms that can be found by selecting the appropriate tab.

==== Name Search

By default when you go to the search page you are on the "Name Search" tab. This gives you a simple text box to enter a
search for the name or names you are looking for.

NOTE: This search **just looks at the full name text,** it is not trying to comprehend the name or its
placement in a classification.

When you type your query into the search box you will get **suggestions** that tell you what your query is likely
to return. The system only returns the first 15 matching names in the suggestion, and will end with an ellipsis (...) if
there are more results. You can click on one of those suggestions to copy it to the search box.

TIP: You don't have to click on or use the suggestions, just press enter or click the search button with your query.

The name search looks at the 'Full Name including the Author', so the system adds an automatic wild card at the end of
the query to match all endings. This means that if you just enter the simple name without author you should find what you want,
however it may also return more than you expect.

The query is **not** case sensitive.

The query is an ordered set of search terms, so viola l. will match "Viola L." and "Viola L. sect Viola."

NOTE: In versions prior to 1.0080 of the NSL services an automatic wild card was added between words (search terms) to match
hybrid names and some other name variants. Hybrids are now specifically catered for in searches and the automatic wild card
has been removed, making the results of the search more logical to most people.

Putting double quotes around your entire query will cause it to be matched exactly (except case). e.g. "Viola L." will match just Viola L.

NOTE: You can use wild cards inside quoted queries to get exactly what you want e.g. "viola betonicifolia subsp. %"

You can use a % as a wild card inside the search query e.g. hakea elon% be or "hakea % var. elon% benth." to find "Hakea ceratophylla var. elongata Benth."

NOTE: Whilst typing in viola will return most names under the genus Viola l. this is a function of the structure of a
scientific name. In fact it will return more names than exist under that genus (91 vs 79).

You can search for hybrids using the letter 'x' or a multiplication sign &mul; if you use a multiplication sign.
