=== Searching the NSL

The current NSL service includes the APNI and APC data. APNI is a nomenclator, it includes a list of names of vascular
plants and where they have been used in references. In this sense, APNI has no opinion about the name, it just states
where it has been used in a reference.

APC is a classification, it has an opinion about what is the accepted name, and where the taxon sits in the classification
"tree".

.What is a tree
****
We make speak of "trees" when referring to classifications in the NSL system, which shouldn't be confused with
actual vascular plants. A tree in this sense is the structure of set of names, so where one name is, say, the family name,
and another the genus, the genus sits "under" the family in the tree. A Family will have many Genus and Species under it.

When you look at the NSL services page you will see the APNI and APC "products" as links in the "Navigation Bar" at the
top of the page. To search APNI click the APNI link.

The search page consists of a set of search forms that can be found by selecting the appropriate tab.

==== Name Search

By default when you go to the search page you are on the "Name Search" tab. This gives you a simple text box to enter a
search for the name or names you are looking for.

NOTE: This search **just looks at the full name text,** it is not trying to comprehend the name or it's
placement in a classification.

When you type your query into the search box you will get suggestions that tell you what your query is likely
to return. The system only returns the first 15 matching names in the suggestion, and will end with an elipsis (...) if
there are more results. You can click on one of those suggestions to get that single result for an exact match.

The name search looks at the 'Full Name including the Author', so the system adds an automatic wild card at the end of
the query to match all endings. This means that if you just enter the simple name without author you should find what you want,
however it may also return more than you expect.

The query you type in is a case insensitive, ordered set of search terms, so viola l. will match Viola suffruticosa L.
and others.

NOTE: Whilst typing in viola will return most names under the genus Viola l. this is a function of the structure of a
scientific name. In fact it will return more names than exist under that genus (91 vs 79).

You can use a "%" as a **wild card** inside the search query e.g. hakea elon% benth to find "Hakea ceratophylla var. elongata Benth."

You can use a "+" in place of a space to make the space match exactly. e.g. viola+L. will match "Viola L." and "Viola L. sect. Viola"

Putting double quotes around your entire query will cause it to be matched exactly. e.g. "Viola L." will match just Viola L.

NOTE: You can use wild cards inside quoted queries to get exactly what you want e.g. "viola betonicifolia subsp. %"
