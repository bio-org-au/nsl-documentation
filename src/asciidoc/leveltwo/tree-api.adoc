=== Tree Structure V1.0
.Under Construction
****
This documentation is under construction. We understand it needs extending and improving, but we thought we'd let you
see what we've got so far.
****

Our tree component stores taxonomic trees, and potentially more. It can store arbitrary document-structured data, such
as profile data, whose elements are identified by RDF classes and predicates.

The tree component holds a full history of every change made to any part of the tree.

The principal design goal is that no persistent footnote:[nodes start in a draft state that permits edits] node of the
tree should ever change. That is: given a publically available
node id, the entire document at that node  - the node itself and all nodes below it - should be stable.

The purpose of
this is to permit node ids to be used as reliable references. Using a node id, an
author can declare that they are using a particular name in a particular classification at a particular time, and that
declaration will not change its meaning as our classifications are maintained and updated.

To make this possible, nodes are never changed - they are replaced by new nodes. footnote:[That is: the _content_ does not
change. The _state_ obviously does, but only in respect of the internal functioning of the tree, not in terms of the node's
nomenclatural or taxonomic meaning or status.]. This replacement propagates upward
through the tree, resulting in a new root node whose entire document includes the new node in place of the previous
one, by way of a series of new nodes along the path from the root to the changed node. In our code, we call this process
"versioning".

The process is somewhat inspired by Git and other version-management tools. We do not use hashes to identify
subdocuments, however, just the nodes themselves. We also do not use timestamps to manage or identify versions of a
node - the structure over time is directly in the nodes and the links between them. footnote:[timestamps are often
problematic, Common problems involving confusions about timezone and system clocks not properly set.]

Our algorithms permit any number of changes to be made to a tree simultaneously. This permits, for instance, a name to
be moved from one higher taxon to another as a single operation. Certain bulk updates which have had to be done as
part of the maintenance of the classification appear as single changes affecting almost all nodes.

Our algorithms permit a node to be used as a subnode of any number of other nodes (provided no cycles are formed). This would permit in future a user to create their own trees that connect together fragments of other trees.

==== Overall Structure

image::Tree-SimplifiedER.png[title="Tree overall structure"]

Our data consists of a number of tree *Nodes*. +
Nodes are linked into directed acyclic graphs with *Links*. +
Nodes each belongs to an *Arrangement*. +
Node lifecycle is recorded in *Events*.

===== Nodes and Links

A node "is" its content and the set of links of which it is the supernode (and therefore the nodes below them). To put it
another way, links are _part of_ the node above them, a node _has_ the links of which it is the supernode.
A change to a link is a change to the node above it, not to the node  below it. Nodes, in a sense, do not care where
they are placed, they include what is placed under them.

Links, therefore, are not separate from nodes and there is not an api to retrieve them separately. A link's identity is
its supernode and its *linkSeq*. A node's links are guaranteed to have unique *linkSeq* numbers but are not
guaranteed to have consecutive *linkSeq* numbers. This makes it possible to work out what about a node has changed
from one version to the next - matching *linkSeq* numbers are "the same" link. If a subnode is deleted from a node,
what will happen is that a new version of the node will be created with that *linkSeq* missing.

===== Arrangements

We use the term "arrangement" in the sense of "an arrangement of nodes". The
term "Tree" or "Classification" is used more strictly - it means an arrangement that has a specific higher-order structure.
Most of the arrangements accessible by the public API are in fact classifications. Other arrangements are used
internally.

Every node belongs to one Arrangement.

Every arrangement has one 'top' node.

Arrangements are where permissions and authorisation is done. We do not have an access control list on every node - it's
done at the arrangement layer.

===== Lifecycle

A node has two events in its lifecycle. It changes from being a draft node to being a (current) persistent node, and it
changes from being a current node to being a replaced node. The *checkedInAt* attribute links to the *Event*
at which a node is made persistent, and the *replacedAt* attribute links to the *Event* at which a node
became replaced.

Most *Events* have many nodes checked in and replaced by them. Events have a timestamp, and so a node is current
from the timestamp of it's *checkedInAt* event up to but not including the timestamp of its *replacedAt* event.

Most of the time, users want to work with the set of current nodes in an arrangement, and our system is optimised
towards that. From the point of view of our editors, the set of current nodes "is" the tree.

===== History

Corresponding to the lifecycle event attributes, a node also has a *prev* and *next* attribute
(which we inconsistently call its *copyOf* and *replacedBy* node in some places). Nodes and links also
have a boolean *synthetic* attribute.

Most of the time, nodes are updated because the nodes beneath them have been updated - a change has been rippled "up
the tree" by the versioning algorithm. In these cases, the *next* and *prev* attributes will form a
doubly-linked list and the node and its links will be marked 'synthetic'.

Cases where this is not true usually indicates a user edit - that something interesting has happened. A newly created
node has no 'prev'. If a node is used in a different tree, and then in that different tree edits are performed, then
the new node will have a 'prev' of the node from which it was copied, but the node from which it was copies will not
indicate that the new node is its 'next'. Many cases are possible, and graphically showing them to a user in a
meaningful and useful way … is something that would be very nice to have.

And so to find points in a node's history where the node itself has been edited for some reason, search for nodes whose
 *synthetic* attribute is `false`.

A node has a *next* node if and only if it has a *replacedAt* event. We therefore have a special *End Node* whose
id is 0 and whose RDF identifier is a constant belonging to the BOA RDF vocabulary footnote:[http://www.biodiversity.org.au/voc/boa/Tree#END-NODE]. This node has to belong to an
arrangement, and so arrangement 0 is the  *End Tree* consisting only of that single node, also having a constant id
that is part of the BOA vocabulary footnote:[http://www.biodiversity.org.au/voc/boa/Tree#END-TREE]. From the point of view of the semantic web, the end node and end tree are each the
same semantic-web "thing" wherever they appear.

The primary reason for this is internal - it is so that SQL queries that look at node histories and changes don't have
to outer join on `node.next_node_id`.

==== Arrangement, Node, and Link internal types

Certain attributes of Arrangements, Nodes, and Links alter how they are treated internally by the system at the
lower level of processing. That is, they do not have taxonomic meaning. These types are separate from the RDF types,
which are discussed in <<Node and Link RDF types>>.

===== Arrangement types

An arrangement may be

*E*: The End Tree:: There is only ever one end tree, and it has an id of 0. Discussed in <<History>>
*P*: Public classification:: This is the most usual type that a user of our API will deal with. Classification trees have
a specific higher-level structure discussed in <<Classification trees>>.
*U*: User:: User trees will be made up of fragments of other trees.
*B*: Bookmark:: These will consist of one (or perhaps several) nodes that "track" nodes in
other arrangements.
*Z*: System temporary:: These are used internally to perform certain operations and discarded.

===== Node types

A node may be

*S*: System node:: These are nodes which are used internally by the system, but which do not have
scientific or taxonomic meaning.
*T*: Taxonomic node:: This node will be associated with a name, and usually with an instance.
*D*: Document node:: These nodes will be collections of value nodes and other document nodes.
*Z*: Temp node:: These are nodes used internally to perform certain operations and discarded.
*V*: Value node:: A value node either has a literal value or is a semantic web URI. +
Value nodes never change, are never replaced, and never have subnodes footnote:[It doesn't make sense to say that 1
has changed into 2. It only makes sense to say that something has a property that has changed from 1 to 2.
That is: you are talking about the link, which belongs to the supernode, not about the value node itself.].
Value nodes are always attached to supernodes with fixed links. In RDF, value nodes do not appear as nodes in their own
right with an identifying URI; they are instead rendered as properties on the Document or Taxonomic node to which they
are attached.

A node may also be synthetic (or not). This is discussed in <<History>>.

===== Link types

A link has a *versioningMethod*. This may be

*V*: Versioning:: If the subnode of the link is replaced with a new version, then the supernode must be replaced
with a new version. +
This is the usual case. Versioning links are how the normal "changes must be rippled up" operation of the system
works. *If the supernode of a versioning link is a current node, then the subnode will also be current.*
*F*: Fixed:: If the subnode of the link is replaced with a new version, then do not ripple the change up. +
Value nodes are always attached to ther supernodes with fixed links. Aside from this, we do not use fixed links at
present, although they may be an option in user-created arrangements. If an arrangement
uses fixed links, then it is not possible to identify nodes currently attached to the root of the tree without
doing a treewalk.
*T*: Tracking:: If the subnode of the link is replaced with a new version, then update the link to refer to the new
version without making a new version of the supernode. +
*The subnode of a tracking link is always a _current_ node*. This even applies to replaced (old) nodes. The tracking
links of replaced nodes are not frozen in time
because "where the tracking link happened to be at the time this node was replaced" doesn't mean anything that could
not be meant by using a versioning link.

We use tracking links to provide a persistent handles to nodes that change over time, to provide a persistent name for
whatever the current version of some other node might be. They do not form part of taxonomic trees footnote:[It might be
reasonable for profile data to be linked to with tracking links, depending on how it is managed. Such a link would be more of
an FYI inclusion - it would mean that the content of the document does not form part of the identity of the taxon].
See <<Classification trees>> for the most important use of
this currently.

==== Node content and Node and Link RDF types

Nodes and links have attributes that carry data. These attributes are not of interest to the low-level maintenance
of the tree structure, but they are of interest to whatever it is that is using the tree to store data.

Firsly, and most obviously, T type nodes usually hold a name and instance id. In NSL, we have a 'Name Tree' whose
main job is to provide Phylum and Family for generic and subgeneric names so that suitable output can be produced.
We also have an 'APC' classification whose job is to hold accepted names and taxa for the Australian Plant Census.

Parallel with the name and instance ids, we also have name and taxon URIs. Name and taxon URIs match the name and instance
ids when these ids refer to names held in the local shard. However, having URIs permit us to create branches that
terminate at names and taxa that are foreign ids.

Along with name and taxon URIs, we also have a 'Resource' URI. This is mainly intended for V (value) type nodes. In
RDF, a value may be a types primitive, or is may be a "resource" - a URI.

Nodes and links also have a Type URI. In RDF, the link type becomes the RDF predicate, and the node type becomes the
type of a typed primitive (where the node is a value), or is used as the OWL class of the node.

The uri type may have meaning within the tree. In particular, our APC tree has nodes of type `APCConcept`, `APCExcluded`,
and `DeclaredBT`. Their meanings are described in <<apc>>.

Physically, our URIs are broken into a
namespace and a an id. These are named `‹Name|Taxon|Resource›UriNsPart` and `‹Name|Taxon|Resource›UriIdPart`. The
original purpose for splitting the URIs in this way was to make it easier to generate RDF. However, now we use D2R
to generate the RDF, which does not use this feature to label the URI prefixes, and this design may be unnecessary.

Uri namespace 0 is always the 'empty' namespace. A namespace of 0 means that the entire URI is in the 'UriIdPart'. The
purpose of this is so that in SQL you don't need to outer join the namespace table.

Uri namespace 1 is always the boatree namespace `http://biodiversity.org.au/voc/boa/Tree#'. This namespace is the prefix
for internal artifacts when they are exposed as RDF.

==== Classification trees

Classification trees are trees that have a specific higher-order structure, a specific way of using the lower-level
data structure and algorithms.

The Arrangement of a classification tree has type `P` - public classification. The arrangement always has a label, and
that label becomes the suffix of the persistent URI identifying the classification.

The top node of the arrangement is a system node `S`. This node has RDF type `classification-node` and holds *one*
tracking link to a taxonomic node `T` of RDF type 'classification-root'.

The classification root is not part of the taxonomy, does not have a name or an instance, and it may have been a
mistake to make it a taxonomic node rather than a system node. We have an unnamed root node because

* having a single taxon at the top level would make it impossible to change the name at the top of the taxonomy while
  recording the history correctly. If our taxonomists were to decide to "push down" the top name, the only way to do it
  would be to change the name of the top node and add a new node under it with the previous name. The versioning history
  would not reflect what actually happened - it would not show that the top node got pushed down and that the new top
  node is new. Instead it would show that the 'Plantae' APC taxon had its name changed to 'Eukaryota' (or whatever).
  This would simply be wrong - the Plantae concept would not have changed, it would just have been moved.
* some taxonomies have multiple taxa at the top level that are not organised into a higher classification. For instance,
  AFD has 'Animalia' and 'Prototheria' at the top level. It would - again - simply be wrong to insist on a top level
  taxon of Eukaryota or "All life on Earth", because these names are _not part of the Australian Faunal Directory_.

The effect of this is that changes in classification trees result in a new `classification-root` node, and those
nodes form a single line of history that can be navigated by looking at their `next`/`prev` attributes and the timestamps
on their associated `Events`. The single `classification-node` acts as a bookmark - its single sublink always points
to the current (most recent) classification root.

There are a couple more rules:

A classification only ever has one current node for any given name. That is - names appear only once. Consequently,
our API for classification is is built entirely around names: "add this name to that name as an excluded name" and
so on.

Every node in a classification arrangement belongs to that arrangement. The purpose of this is to expedite the most
important and common operation: find a name's current placement in a classification.

*IF* a node

* has the name you are looking for; AND
* belongs to the classification you are searching; AND
* is current

*THEN*

* it is the current placement of that name in that classification
* it will have *one* superlink that links it to a node that
** also belongs to the classification; AND
** is current

Both of these conditions need to be checked. Nodes may be included as subnodes in user classifications, and nodes
will be placed under multiple copies of a supernode when sibling nodes are updated. However, only one will be current.

And remember - this only applies to Arrangements of type `P`, which are maintained in such a way as these rules are 
followed.


=== Tree API for JSON V1.0
